Reqs:
 - Track One Habit
 - Store quantity of something
 - Create sqldb if one doesn't exist
 - Create table in db

 - Should show options to users
 - Insert, Delete, Update, View
 - Handle all possible errors, never crash
 - Insert 0 at any point terminates program
 - Use raw SQL to interact with DB

Design:
 - Health tracker app
 - Track IF an exercise has engaged this day
 - Track IF healthy eating has engaged this day
 - Can get dates for upto 5 days before today. Any older than that you've missed out.
 - Cannot enter tracker for exercise or healthy eating if already

Two tables I guess, one for exercise and one for healthy eating
 - Record date, string for the exercise, string for the healthy eating, boolean flags for each if engaged
 - Joining table
